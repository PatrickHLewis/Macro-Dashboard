When a depository institution has surplus balances in its reserve account, it lends to other banks in need of larger balances. In simpler terms, a bank with excess cash, which is often referred to as liquidity, will lend to another bank that needs to quickly raise liquidity. (1) The rate that the borrowing institution pays to the lending institution is determined between the two banks; the weighted average rate for all of these types of negotiations is called the effective federal funds rate.(2) The effective federal funds rate is essentially determined by the market but is influenced by the Federal Reserve through open market operations to reach the federal funds rate target.(2)\\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times a year to determine the federal funds target rate. As previously stated, this rate influences the effective federal funds rate through open market operations or by buying and selling of government bonds (government debt).(2) More specifically, the Federal Reserve decreases liquidity by selling government bonds, thereby raising the federal funds rate because banks have less liquidity to trade with other banks. Similarly, the Federal Reserve can increase liquidity by buying government bonds, decreasing the federal funds rate because banks have excess liquidity for trade. Whether the Federal Reserve wants to buy or sell bonds depends on the state of the economy. If the FOMC believes the economy is growing too fast and inflation pressures are inconsistent with the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve, the Committee may set a higher federal funds rate target to temper economic activity. In the opposing scenario, the FOMC may set a lower federal funds rate target to spur greater economic activity. Therefore, the FOMC must observe the current state of the economy to determine the best course of monetary policy that will maximize economic growth while adhering to the dual mandate set forth by Congress. In making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC considers a wealth of economic data, such as: trends in prices and wages, employment, consumer spending and income, business investments, and foreign exchange markets.\\nThe federal funds rate is the central interest rate in the U.S. financial market. It influences other interest rates such as the prime rate, which is the rate banks charge their customers with higher credit ratings. Additionally, the federal funds rate indirectly influences longer- term interest rates such as mortgages, loans, and savings, all of which are very important to consumer wealth and confidence.(2)\\nReferences\\n(1) Federal Reserve Bank of New York. \\\"Federal funds.\\\" Fedpoints, August 2007.\\n(2) Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \\\"Monetary Policy (https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy.htm)\\\".\"}, \"IC4WSA\": {\"title\": \"4-Week Moving Average of Initial Claims\", \"units\": \"Number\", \"frequency\": \"Weekly, Ending Saturday\", \"seasonal_adjustment\": \"Seasonally Adjusted\", \"notes\": \"An initial claim is a claim filed by an unemployed individual after a separation from an employer.

This measure accounts for approximately 80 percent of the workers who contribute to Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\\n\\nThis measure provides useful insights into the current economic situation because it can represent the number of jobs added or lost in an economy. Increases in employment might indicate that businesses are hiring which might also suggest that businesses are growing. Additionally, those who are newly employed have increased their personal incomes, which means (all else constant) their disposable incomes have also increased, thus fostering further economic expansion.\\n\\nGenerally, the U.S. labor force and levels of employment and unemployment are subject to fluctuations due to seasonal changes in weather, major holidays, and the opening and closing of schools. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) adjusts the data to offset the seasonal effects to show non-seasonal changes: for example, women's participation in the labor force; or a general decline in the number of employees, a possible indication of a downturn in the economy. To closely examine seasonal and non-seasonal changes, the BLS releases two monthly statistical measures: the seasonally adjusted All Employees: Total Nonfarm (PAYEMS) and All Employees: Total Nonfarm (PAYNSA), which is not seasonally adjusted.\\n\\nThe series comes from the 'Current Employment Statistics (Establishment Survey).'\\n\\nThe source code is: CES0000000001\"}, \"STLFSI4\": {\"title\": \"St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index\", \"units\": \"Index\", \"frequency\": \"Weekly, Ending Friday\", \"seasonal_adjustment\": \"Not Seasonally Adjusted\", \"notes\": \"The STLFSI4 measures the degree of financial stress in the markets and is constructed from 18 weekly data series: seven interest rate series, six yield spreads and five other indicators.

Percent changes in the price index measure the inflation rate between any two time periods. The most common inflation metric is the percent change from one year ago. It can also represent the buying habits of urban consumers. This particular index includes roughly 88 percent of the total population, accounting for wage earners, clerical workers, technical workers, self-employed, short-term workers, unemployed, retirees, and those not in the labor force.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CPIs are based on prices for food, clothing, shelter, and fuels; transportation fares; service fees (e.g., water and sewer service); and sales taxes. Prices are collected monthly from about 4,000 housing units and approximately 26,000 retail establishments across 87 urban areas. To calculate the index, price changes are averaged with weights representing their importance in the spending of the particular group. The index measures price changes (as a percent change) from a predetermined reference date. In addition to the original unadjusted index distributed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics also releases a seasonally adjusted index. The unadjusted series reflects all factors that may influence a change in prices. However, it can be very useful to look at the seasonally adjusted CPI, which removes the effects of seasonal changes, such as weather, school year, production cycles, and holidays.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CPI can be used to recognize periods of inflation and deflation. Significant increases in the CPI within a short time frame might indicate a period of inflation, and significant decreases in CPI within a short time frame might indicate a period of deflation. However, because the CPI includes volatile food and oil prices, it might not be a reliable measure of inflationary and deflationary periods. For a more accurate detection, the core CPI (CPILFESL (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPILFESL)) is often used. When using the CPI, please note that it is not applicable to all consumers and should not be used to determine relative living costs. Additionally, the CPI is a statistical measure vulnerable to sampling error since it is based on a sample of prices and not the complete average.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more information on the consumer price indexes, see:  \\r\\nBureau of Economic Analysis. \\\"CPI Detailed Report.\\\" (https://www.bls.gov/cpi/) 2013.  \\r\\nHandbook of Methods (https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/pdf/cpihom.pdf)  \\r\\nUnderstanding the CPI: Frequently Asked Questions (https://www.bls.gov/cpi/questions-and-answers.htm)\"}, \"NROU\": {\"title\": \"Noncyclical Rate of Unemployment\", \"units\": \"Percent\", \"frequency\": \"Quarterly\", \"seasonal_adjustment\": \"Not Seasonally Adjusted\", \"notes\": \"Starting with the July, 2021 report: An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: 2021 to 2031 (https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57218), this series was renamed from \\\"Natural Rate of Unemployment (Long-Term)\\\" to \\\"Noncyclical Rate of Unemployment\\\".\\n\\nThe natural rate of unemployment (NAIRU) is the rate of unemployment arising from all sources except fluctuations in aggregate demand.

The short-term natural rate incorporates structural factors that are temporarily boosting the natural rate beginning in 2008.
